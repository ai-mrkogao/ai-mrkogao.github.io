### Understand Memory Augmented Reinforcement Learning
- Can we learn an agent with an external memory?
- external memory (Read/Write)

### Current Memory for RL agents
  - current memory structures for RL are simple
    - just add LSTM to network
  - partially observable 
    - 3D games
    - Autonomous robots
  - Memory structures will be crucial to scaling up deep RL agents to partially-observable and non-reflexive tasks
