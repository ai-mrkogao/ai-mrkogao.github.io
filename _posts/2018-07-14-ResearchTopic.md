## Research Topic Summarization

- ### [keras RL tutorial](https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl) includes below topics
  > ![keras tutorial](../../pictures/topic/keras_RL_tutorial.png){:height="80%" width="80%"} 

- ### [A3C Doom simulation](https://github.com/awjuliani/DeepRL-Agents/blob/master/A3C-Doom.ipynb)
  > This iPython notebook includes an implementation of the A3C algorithm. In it we use A3C to solve a simple 3D Doom challenge using the VizDoom engine. For more information on A3C, see the accompanying Medium post.

- ### [Behavioral Cloning in autonomous driving](https://github.com/JunshengFu/driving-behavioral-cloning)
  > Coded a Deep Neural Network to Steer a Car in a game simulator. Neural Network directly predicts the steering angles from the image of front camera in the car. The training data is only collected in track 1 by manually driving two laps and the neural network learns to drive the car on different tracks.

- ### [2D unity car simulation](https://github.com/ArztSamuel/Applying_EANNs)
  > A 2D Unity simulation in which cars learn to navigate themselves through different courses. The cars are steered by a feedforward neural network. The weights of the network are trained using a modified genetic algorithm.

- ### [Using Python programming to Play Grand Theft Auto 5](https://github.com/sentdex/pygta5)
  > Explorations of Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5, mainly for the purposes of creating self-driving cars and other vehicles.

- ### [Using OpenAI with ROS](http://www.theconstructsim.com/using-openai-ros/)
  > The drone training example
  In this example, we are going to train a ROS based drone to be able to go to a location of the space moving as low as possible (may be to avoid being detected), but avoiding obstacles in its way.

- ### [Guided Policy SearchÂ¶](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps/)
  > This code is a reimplementation of the guided policy search algorithm and LQG-based trajectory optimization, meant to help others understand, reuse, and build upon existing work. It includes a complete robot controller and sensor interface for the PR2 robot via ROS, and an interface for simulated agents in Box2D and MuJoCo. Source code is available on GitHub.

  While the core functionality is fully implemented and tested, the codebase is a work in progress. See the FAQ for information on planned future additions to the code.
