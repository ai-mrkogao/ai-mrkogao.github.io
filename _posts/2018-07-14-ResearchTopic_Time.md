- ### [TreasureBot](https://github.com/SamuelePolimi/TreasureBot)  
  > Probably everybody who studied machine learning thought how to use it to solve financial problem (buy and sell stocks perhaps). A very interesting article shows how to do it with direct reinforcement Learning [1]. We try to impement the idea presented in the article with some slight modification (LSTM instead of recurrent neural network, for example) and some innovative techniques.
