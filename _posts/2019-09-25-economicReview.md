## 2019-09-25 Dow,SPY,IXIC Position (!! Critical !!)

## This is deep learning analysis of Dow index about anomaly detection and reinforcement_learning for how to decide the trading

- Above figure, Kosdaq(Korea Russel2000) index is moving sideways but I think we will see the inflection point soon
- purple points is going down and if it will go down for 2-3 days we will see the down trend

### Korea Kospi trend analysis  

![](../../pictures/stock_analysis/20190925_kospi.png)  
- 20190924 : sell pct 0.17 buy pct 0.83
- 20190925 : sell pct 0.31 buy pct 0.69
- Blue points represent buying power is greater than selling power so right now buying power is still superior to selling but buy percentage is decreasing(0.69 from 0.83)
- Key level is 27300 in Kodex200 ETF, if it is broken down and Red points appears we must prepare for massive selling


### SK hynix
