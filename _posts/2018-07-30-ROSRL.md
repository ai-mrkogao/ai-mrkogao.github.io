Content based on Erle Robotics's whitepaper: <a href="http://erlerobotics.com/whitepaper/robot_gym.pdf">Extending the OpenAI Gym for robotics: a toolkit for reinforcement learning using ROS and Gazebo</a>.
</p>

- The work presented here follows the same baseline structure displayed by researchers in the OpenAI Gym, and builds a gazebo environment
- OpenAI gym focuses on the episodic setting of RL, aiming to maximize the expectation of total reward each episode
- ***This toolkit aims to integrate the gym API with robotic hardware, validating reinforcement learning algorithm in real environments***
- Real world operation is achieved combining  [Gazebo simulator](http://gazebosim.org) with the  [Robot Operating System](http://ros.org), a set of libraries and tools that help software developers create robot applications
- The main problem with RL in robotics is the high cost per trial which is not only the economical cost but also the long time needed to perform learning operation
- Another issue is that learning with a real robot in a real environment can be dangerous

# Architecture

    <div><i>Simplified software architecture used in OpenAI Gym for robotics.</i></div>
    <br>

- The architecture consists of three main software blocks: OpenAI Gym,ROS and Gazebo
- Gazebo provides a robust physics engine, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces
- The architecture described was tested with three different robots:  
  - [Erle-Copter](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-copter/)

  - [Erle-Rover](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/erle-rover/)

  - [Turtlebot](http://www.turtlebot.com/)


# Getting your robot into the gym

- Let's go ahead and code of a simple example with this OpenAI Gym extension for robotics(that we call the robot gym)
- We'll take the turtlebot and use RL(Q-learning) to teach the robot how to avoid obstacles using only a simulated LIDAR

Getting everything ready for the <i>robot gym</i> to work will need you to set it up appropriately. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/erlerobot/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/gazebo/INSTALL.md">these instructions</a> and do it yourself.<br>

# An OpenAI gym extension for using Gazebo known as `gym-gazebo`
- This work presents an extension of the initial OpenAI gym for robotics using ROS and Gazebo. A whitepaper about this work is available at [Extending the OpenAI Gym for robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05742). Please use the following BibTex entry to cite our work:

# Community-maintained environments
The following are some of the gazebo environments maintained by the community using `gym-gazebo`. If you'd like to contribute and maintain an additional environment, submit a Pull Request with the corresponding addition.

| Name | Middleware | Description | Observation Space | Action Space | Reward range |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| ![GazeboCircuit2TurtlebotLidar-v0](../../pictures/rosrl/GazeboCircuit2TurtlebotLidar-v0.png)`GazeboCircuit2TurtlebotLidar-v0` | ROS | A simple circuit with straight tracks and 90 degree turns. Highly discretized LIDAR readings are used to train the Turtlebot. Scripts implementing **Q-learning** and **Sarsa** can be found in the _examples_ folder. | | | |
| ![GazeboCircuitTurtlebotLidar-v0](../../pictures/rosrl/GazeboCircuitTurtlebotLidar-v0.png)`GazeboCircuitTurtlebotLidar-v0.png` | ROS | A more complex maze  with high contrast colors between the floor and the walls. Lidar is used as an input to train the robot for its navigation in the environment. | | | TBD |
| `GazeboMazeErleRoverLidar-v0` | ROS, [APM](https://github.com/erlerobot/ardupilot) | **Deprecated** | | | |
| `GazeboErleCopterHover-v0` | ROS, [APM](https://github.com/erlerobot/ardupilot) | **Deprecated** | | | |
