## Explorations of Using Python to play Grand Theft Auto 5

- GTA 5 is a great environment to practice in for a variety of reasons
- With GTA, we can use modes to control the time of day, weather,traffic,speeds, what happens when we crash, all kinds of things
- It is a just a completely customizable environment
- This method can be done on a variety of games
- This initial goal is to create a sort of self-driving car
- The method he will use to access the game should be do-able on almost any game
- Things like sun glare in GAT V will make computer vision much more challenging, but also more realistic
- We can teach an AI to play games by simply showing it how to play for a bit, using CNN on that information, and then letting the AI poke around
- Here are initial thoughts
  - We can access frames from the scree
  - We can mimic key-presses(sendkeys,pyautogui and probably many other options)
- This is enough for rudimentary tasks, but what about for deep learning?
- The only extra thing we might want is something that can also log various events from the game world
- Since most games are played almost completely visually, we can handle for that, and we can also track mouse position and key presses, allowing us to engage in deep learning
- Main concern is processing everything fast enough 
- So this is quite a large project
- The initial goals are
  1. Access the game screen at a somewhat decent FPS
       Anything over 5 should be workable for us, unpleasant to watch, but workable,and we can always watch the actual live game, rather than the processing frames 
  2. Send keyboard input to game screen. 
  3. Try some form of joystick input if possible(especially considering throttle and turning)
  4. Simple self-driving car that stays in some lanes under simple conditions(High sun,clear day, no rain, no traffic...)

## So step 1, how should we actually accesses our screen? 
  - refer to this implementation [stackoverflow impl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24129253/screen-capture-with-opencv-and-python-2-7), it just appears to have a typo on the import, ImageGrab is part of PIL

```python
import numpy as np
# from PIL import ImageGrab # Windows or Mac
import pyscreenshot as ImageGrab # Ubuntu
import cv2
import time

def screen_record(): 
    last_time = time.time()
    while(True):
        # 800x600 windowed mode
        printscreen =  np.array(ImageGrab.grab(bbox=(0,40,800,640)))
        print('loop took {} seconds'.format(time.time()-last_time))
        last_time = time.time()
        cv2.imshow('window',cv2.cvtColor(printscreen, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
        if cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            cv2.destroyAllWindows()
            break
```
- ImageGrab is only availeble for Windows or Mac
[Python: Using Pyscreenshot image to get RGB values (Linux)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39769829/python-using-pyscreenshot-image-to-get-rgb-values-linux)
- This gives 12 ~ 13 FPS

## The next thing we want to do is to run OpenCV on the captured screen data
- We'll convert the image to grayscale to simplify things and edge detection to eventually be used for finding the lines that will be our lanes

- let's add some grayscale and edges

```python
import numpy as np
# from PIL import ImageGrab
import pyscreenshot as ImageGrab # Ubuntu
import cv2
import time


def process_img(image):
    original_image = image
    # convert to gray
    processed_img = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # edge detection
    processed_img =  cv2.Canny(processed_img, threshold1 = 200, threshold2=300)
    return processed_img

def main():
    last_time = time.time()
    while True:
        screen =  np.array(ImageGrab.grab(bbox=(0,40,800,640)))
        #print('Frame took {} seconds'.format(time.time()-last_time))
        last_time = time.time()
        new_screen = process_img(screen)
        cv2.imshow('window', new_screen)
        #cv2.imshow('window',cv2.cvtColor(screen, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
        if cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            cv2.destroyAllWindows()
            break
```
![capture_grayscale](../../pictures/pygta5/capture_grayscale.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

## pyautogui, Control the keyboard and mouse from a Python script

```python
import pyautogui
import time
# gives us time to get situated in the game
for i in list(range(4))[::-1]:
    print(i+1)
    time.sleep(1)

print('down')
pyautogui.keyDown('w') 
time.sleep(3)
print('up')
pyautogui.keyUp('w') 
>>
4
3
2
1
down
up
```
- But Some games want "Direct Input" instead of pyautogui sendkeys
